- **Target SDK**: API 36
- **Compile SDK**: API 36

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio (Latest version recommended)
- Wear OS emulator or physical Wear OS device
- Android SDK with Wear OS support

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blazebsc/WearOS-Stopwatch.git
   cd WearOS-Stopwatch
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio

3. Sync Gradle files

4. Connect your Wear OS device or start an emulator

5. Run the app:

   - Use the command line: `./gradlew installDebug`

## Usage

### Basic Operations

- **Start/Stop**: Tap the play/pause button to start or stop the timer
- **Lap**: Tap the flag button to record a lap time (only available when running)
- **Reset**: Tap the replay button to reset the stopwatch to 00.00
- **View Laps**: Swipe up on the main screen to see all recorded lap times
- **Return**: Swipe down from the lap view to return to the main stopwatch

## Architecture

The app follows modern Android architecture best practices:

- **MVVM Pattern**: Separation of UI and business logic
- **State Management**: Reactive UI with Compose state
- **Lifecycle Awareness**: ViewModel integration for configuration changes
- **Coroutines**: Non-blocking timer updates at ~60 FPS
